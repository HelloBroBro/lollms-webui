# LoLLMs Anything to Markdown Library

## Overview

The LoLLMs Anything to Markdown Library is a versatile JavaScript tool designed to convert various file types into Markdown format. This library simplifies the process of extracting text content from different file formats and presenting it in a universally readable Markdown structure.

## Features

- Supports multiple file formats including plain text, DOCX, PDF, and PPTX
- Asynchronous file processing
- Object-oriented design for easy extensibility
- Basic Markdown conversion with room for customization
- Error handling for unsupported file types and processing errors

## Installation

To use the LoLLMs Anything to Markdown Library, include the following script in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="path/to/lollms-anything-to-markdown"></script>
```

Make sure to also include the necessary dependencies for processing specific file types:

- For DOCX: [Mammoth.js](https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js)
- For PDF: [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/)
- For PPTX: A custom PptxTextExtractor library (not provided in this documentation)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```javascript
const lollmsFileLoader = new LollmsFileLoader();

async function handleFileUpload(event) {
    const file = event.target.files[0];
    if (!file) return;

    try {
        const markdown = await lollmsFileLoader.loadFile(file);
        console.log(markdown);
        // Use the markdown content as needed
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error processing file:', error);
        alert('Error processing file: ' + error.message);
    }
}
```

### Supported File Types

The library supports the following file extensions:

- Plain text: txt, md, markdown, rtf, log, csv, json, xml, html, htm, css, js, py, java, c, cpp
- Microsoft Word: docx
- PDF: pdf
- Microsoft PowerPoint: pptx

## API Reference

### LollmsFileLoader Class

The main class of the library, responsible for loading and converting files.

#### Methods

##### `constructor()`

Initializes a new LollmsFileLoader instance.

##### `async loadFile(file)`

Loads and converts a file to Markdown.

- Parameters:
  - `file`: File object to be processed
- Returns: A Promise that resolves with the Markdown content of the file
- Throws: Error if the file type is unsupported or if processing fails

##### `readTextFile(file)`

Reads the content of a text-based file.

- Parameters:
  - `file`: File object to be read
- Returns: A Promise that resolves with the text content of the file

##### `readDocxFile(file)`

Extracts text content from a DOCX file.

- Parameters:
  - `file`: DOCX File object to be processed
- Returns: A Promise that resolves with the extracted text content

##### `readPdfFile(file)`

Extracts text content from a PDF file.

- Parameters:
  - `file`: PDF File object to be processed
- Returns: A Promise that resolves with the extracted text content

##### `readPptxFile(file)`

Extracts text content from a PPTX file.

- Parameters:
  - `file`: PPTX File object to be processed
- Returns: A Promise that resolves with the extracted text content

##### `convertToMarkdown(content, fileExtension)`

Converts the extracted content to Markdown format.

- Parameters:
  - `content`: String containing the extracted text content
  - `fileExtension`: String representing the original file's extension
- Returns: A string containing the Markdown-formatted content

## Extending the Library

The LoLLMs Anything to Markdown Library is designed to be easily extensible. Here are some ways you can extend its functionality:

1. Add support for new file types by creating new read methods and adding the file extension to the `supportedExtensions` array.
2. Enhance the Markdown conversion logic in the `convertToMarkdown` method to handle more complex document structures.
3. Implement additional post-processing steps for specific file types.
4. Add a caching mechanism to store processed files for quicker access.

## Error Handling

The library uses a Promise-based approach for error handling. Errors are thrown in the following scenarios:

- Unsupported file type
- Failure to read or process a file
- Missing dependencies (e.g., PptxTextExtractor for PPTX files)

It's recommended to wrap the `loadFile` method call in a try-catch block to handle these errors gracefully in your application.

## Limitations

- The current implementation provides basic Markdown conversion and may not capture all formatting details from complex documents.
- Processing large files, especially PDFs with many pages, may be time-consuming.
- The library relies on external dependencies for processing DOCX, PDF, and PPTX files, which need to be included separately.
